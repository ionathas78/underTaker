> Notes Can Too Be Fun!

A note taker app using a JSON database sounds pretty basic, but the exercise was really one in getting the server to respond to data and API requests, and that was interesting. This front-end was provided by the course, so it's nothing special. Personally, I'd have loved to integrate importance flags, note tags with full search and sort capability, and text formatting. Maybe next time. Maybe in SQL...

## Technologies


## Getting Started
```
npm install
```
express() is the only dependency in this package, so installation is pretty straightforward.


## Usage
```
node server

> App listening on PORT 9733
```

Starting the server on localhost is as simple as running server.js.
After that, you can hit the page at port 9733.

```
> TYPE:
localhost:9733
>  in your preferred web browser.
```
